Next, I will provide you with code requirements, and you will generate the code.
Please note that there is a rule for your responses : 
From now on, in your responses, in any cases, DO NOT include any natural language, explanations, descriptions, or introductions.
Only provide Java code directly in your responses.
DO NOT start with "Sure, here's an implementation..."
